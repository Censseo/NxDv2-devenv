
Before deploying, we need to install the vb guests:
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest

Then:
vagrant up

Once the vm finished its deployment, you can either go to http://localhost:9100 to access to VS Code on the server, 
or connect your VS Code by SSH by following this:

vagrant ssh-config
Copy the output
Now in vs code install the extension Remote-SSH
In the lower left corner we click on the arrows, then we select Remote-ssh: Open configuration file 
we paste the configuration that we copied in step 2
Select our connection on remote explorer and connect with vagrant.

To connect on the vm with a terminal, type 
vagrant ssh 
from the base folder
